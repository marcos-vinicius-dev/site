Currently, we are completely\r\n                        self-funded and most of us work part-time on the project. If we were to continue this way, it\r\n                        would\r\n                        take us years to build Openbook. We decided to go for crowdfunding because we want this to be a\r\n                        project driven by people not by capital. It makes such a big difference on the decisions taken.”\r\n                    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The crowdfunding campaign for Openbook will take place in the Kickstarter platform, on the\r\n                        15thof\r\n                        July, 2018.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        If you want to learn more about it or keep up with the developments of Openbook, you can find them\r\n                        online at https://openbook.social or at Twitter @OpenbookSocial.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <section class=\"section\" id=\"inquiries\">\r\n            <div class=\"small-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"content is-medium\">\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Missing something?
