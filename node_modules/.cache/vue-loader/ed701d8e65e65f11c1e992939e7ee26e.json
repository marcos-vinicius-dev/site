We don’t track anything you do or use your data for any other purpose than providing the social networking functionality. We’re also fully transparent about this, all of our code is open-source, so people can see that we do what we say we do.

Openbook does this by allowing our users to personalise almost everything visual on the network.” Openbook also makes the switch from other social network as easy as possible. “With our simple drag-and-drop tool you can easily transfer the data from your old social networks”. As for the revenue model, it is said to be based on transactions between users.\n                </p>\n\n                <blockquote>\n                    “We are really focused on building a better social network than anything that’s out there, not only in terms of security & privacy, but experience as well. Once we achieve that, we want to create a way for transactions to occur between users. This will then be used to create a marketplace for products and later on a marketplace for services. Our revenue model will never be advertisement.”\n                </blockquote>\n\n                <p>\n                    The team behind Openbook consists of people who believe in the main values Openbook stands for: honesty, respect for users, togetherness, altruism and fun.

Ads are the reason social networks started to collect increasingly more\n                    information about their users in order to serve them personalized ads and increase revenue. This\n                    combined with the social network’s little interest to protect the collected information is what\n                    gave\n                    rise to the loss of privacy and the inability to fix the problem.
